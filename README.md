# Angular Sandbox

Step by step guide on [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework with code examples.

## What is Angular

**Angular** is a **JavaScript** framework, that uses **HTML**, **CSS** and **TypeScript** to build client-side applications.

## Angular's benefits

* Allows to embed features (E.g. loops, local variables, if stetements) into **HTML**, which makes it more expressive.

* Provides data binding functionalities that allow to bind data to the **UI**

* Enforces modular design
* Provides built in functionalities that ease up Back-End integration

## Angular application architecture

Angular applications consist of multiple **components** and **services** (E.g. service for accessing data from Back-End app), that can be shared between these.

### Components

An **Angular component** consists of:

* **Template** - **HTML** that defines the view
* **Class** associated with the view, which consists of:  
  * **Properties** - Data elements available for binding to the view
  * **Methods** - Actions for the view that perform actions like response for uses input

   It can be also called **Code Behind**
* **Metadata** that provides additional information about the component to **Angular**
